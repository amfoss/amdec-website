## Topic - Web Development

### Description 

NiDar ,  A project for "Women Security".  We felt that preventing such incidents is better . We came up with an idea to make a map which shows the safest route to travel for women. We took police stations, Commercial places as the safer place for women to travel. And the vice versa with Bars ,Clubs which are not much safer for women to travel.

We got the data from the google maps API. We made the place near the police stations , commercial area to green color in the map and places near the bar and clubs to red color. And  we had an android app which is Live, Hasslefree, One tap incident reporting. And the place will be marked with red color.
